# TRO_HBN
This workspace is the source code of the manuscript HBN, submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Robotics. This work is under peer review now. These are demo codes that can be rapidly operated by virtual experiment. Hyperparameters and settings can be slightly different than those indicated in the manuscript. 

# Demos
