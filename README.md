# Probabilistic Modeling and Bayesian Filtering for Improved State Estimation for Soft Robots
This workspace is the source code of the paper titled "Probabilistic Modeling and Bayesian Filtering for Improved State Estimation for Soft Robots," by DongWook Kim, Myungsun Park, and Yong-Lae Park. This paper is currently published at Early view in IEEE Transactions on Robotics [<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9380198">Link</a>].

These are demo codes that can be rapidly operated by virtual experiment. Hyperparameters and settings can be slightly different than those indicated in the manuscript.
